## Vibe Trading Manifesto

"Vibe trading" — inspired by vibe coding, leverages LLMs to enhance trade execution via natural language prompts.

## The Next Evolution: Vibe Trading

Trade financial markets by simply expressing your ideas, hunches, or strategies in plain language. "vibe coding" a term popularized by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy to describe using AI to turn natural language into working code—vibe trading brings this revolution to finance. Now, you can say things like “be conservative when uncertain” or “short the worst-performing memecoin,” and AI agents will translate your intent into real trades, manage your portfolio, and adapt to market conditions—all in real time.

## Vibe Trading Synthesizes

## Classification of Prompts

- **Contextual** - Shape the agent’s mindset (“be aggressive on memecoins,” “prioritize low-risk assets”).
- **Actionable** - Direct action (“short ETH,” “buy BTC if it dips 5%”).

```
Prompt - “memecoin szn is dead, short the worst-performing memecoin.”
- context (memecoin sze is dead)
